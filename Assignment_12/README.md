# Bank Marketing Campaign Dataset Cleaning

## Project Description

As part of my Bytewise ML Fellowship, I completed a project focused on data cleaning, a fundamental skill for data engineers. This project involves processing a bank marketing campaign dataset to enhance its usability for further analysis.

In this notebook, I applied various data-cleaning techniques to the dataset from a bank's marketing campaigns. The tasks included modifying values, adding new features, converting data types, and saving the cleaned data into multiple CSV files.

## Project Instructions

1. ### Subset, Clean, and Reformat:
   - I divided the `bank_marketing.csv` dataset into three subsets: `client`, `campaign`, and `economics`.
   - Each subset was formatted according to specific requirements, including data type conversions and value adjustments.

2. ### Save DataFrames:
   - I saved the cleaned DataFrames as CSV files without an index. The resulting files are named `client.csv`, `campaign.csv`, and `economics.csv`.

## Files

- `client.csv`: Contains the cleaned client data.
- `campaign.csv`: Contains the cleaned campaign data.
- `economics.csv`: Contains the cleaned economic data.
